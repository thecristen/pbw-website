                    <img src="http://placehold.it/200x200">
                    <h3>Founder, CEO, President</h3>
                    <p>Niaja is an Electrical Engineering PhD student at MIT and is currently a member of the Fluid Interfaces group at the MIT Media Lab. The concept and need to provide outreach and opportunities for STEM students, originated out of Niaja’s observations as an electrical engineering student, and was an idea which she found attracted the attention of large research panels.  Her concept was submitted and funded, and i-Trek was born. Niaja received her BS from Morgan State University in 2010, and a MS from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT, in 2012, both in Electrical Engineering. At Morgan State she led the first SCUBA Club and the Engineering Student Organization Council. More recently at MIT she won first place in the Founder’s Journey Education Challenge, second place in the Computational Camera’s Application Competition, and earned a Teaching Certificate from the Dean of Graduate Education. Founding i-Trek is her most recent way of giving back to the community, and as is evident, outreach has been one of her passions. Past efforts include serving as a volunteer with BICO (Baltimore Inner City Outings) in Baltimore, MD, tutoring middle and high school students in math, and cleaning up community gardens. She has also facilitated and attended undergraduate school site visits, giving presentations on graduate school as a means of further inspiring students from underserved institutions to take the next step and enroll in  graduate school. Overall, she has a passion for knowledge, giving back to the community and finding creative solutions to challenging, real world problems.</p>
